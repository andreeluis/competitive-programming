Read **three** integers and sort them in **ascending order**. After, print these values in ascending order, a blank line and then the values in the **sequence as they were readed**.

> ### Input
> The input contains three integer numbers.

> ### Output
> Present the output as requested above.

## 💡 Solution Explanation
This problem is straightforward and involves basic comparison using `if` and `else` statements.

To solve this problem, we need to read three integer values and determine their order by comparing them directly. This can be done using a series of conditional statements to check the relative order of the numbers.
