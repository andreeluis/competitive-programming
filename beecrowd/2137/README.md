In a quiet country town, Mr. Severino has decided to set up his own library, as he collects several books since his youth. He knows nothing about programming, so he asked his grandson to make a program that registers and sorts his books by their code. However, his grandson is still in elementary school, and since he knows very little about programming, he ended up making a program that only registers the books, but doesn't sort them.
Thereby, Severino has turned to you, because he knows about your programming skills. Your task is simple: **sort the books by their code**.

> ### Input
> The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer $N$ $(1 ≤ N ≤ 1000)$. The subsequent `N` lines will have the book's code, which are always in the form `xxxx`, that is, there will be no registration `1`, for example, but `0001`.
>
> Read input until `EOF`.

> ### Output
> Print the registration of the book's code sorted. There's no newline between the test cases.

## 💡 Solution Explanation
To solve this problem, the list of book codes must be sorted in ascending order and then printed.
