Read a value `N`. Calculate and write its corresponding factorial.
Factorial of $N = N * (N-1) * (N-2) * (N-3) * ... * 1$.

> ### Input
> The input contains an integer value $N$ $(0 < N < 13)$.

> ### Output
> The output contains an integer value corresponding to the factorial of `N`.

## üí° Solution Explanation
This problem is straightforward and involves basic arithmetic operations.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the factorial of a given number `N`. This can be done using a loop to multiply the current value by the previous one until we reach `1`.
