Full of good ideas, now, the Brazilian government decided to create the "**height benefit**". This way, you were instructed to survey the height of the population of various cities and to sort this population in ascending order of height. You know that the cities that you have to to do this don't have more than 3 million of people and, according to the IBGE, in these cities, no one person has more than 230 cm.

> ### Input
> The input contains many test cases. The first line of input contains an integer $NC$ $(NC < 100)$ that indicates the among of test cases, ie. cities. For each test case, the first line will contain an integer $N$ $(1 < N ≤ 3000000)$, indicating the among of people in the city. The next line will contain the height of each one of these citizen, in centimeters, represented by $h$ $(20 ≤ h  ≤ 230)$. Each height is separated by a blank space.

> ### Output
> For each test case, print a line containing all numbers representing the height of all citizens (in cm) in ascending order, separated by a blank space.

## 💡 Solution Explanation
To solve this problem, the list of heights for each city must be sorted in ascending order and then printed.
